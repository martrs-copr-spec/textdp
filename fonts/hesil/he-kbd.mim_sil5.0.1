;; keyboard layout.

(description 
 "Hebrew input method simulating the SIL Biblical Hebrew keyboard. 
 It follows the keystrokes of the SIL Biblical Hebrew keyboard for 
 all numbers and English punctuation marks, all Hebrew consonants, 
 all common Hebrew vowel points, plus the maqaf, dagesh, meteg, 
 etnahta, rafe, and sof pasuq. The accent ole is also included as it can 
 be used as a general marker of syllabic stress in non-accented texts. 
 Departing from the SIL Biblical Hebrew keyboard, the backslash key 
 inputs a backslash rather than the paseq. The layout uses CTRL+ALT
 instead of ALTGR. This input method works well with the SBL Hebrew 
 font, but it has been observed that the dagesh needs to be entered 
 immediately after the consonant when using the Ezra SIL font.  
 See <http://www.sbl-site.org/Fonts/BiblicalHebrewSILManual.pdf> 
 for a description of the SIL Biblical Hebrew keyboard.")
